Running filter3.py will overwrite the data in todays_stock.csv every day, and the updated data will be stored in filtered_stock.csv (where all the previous filtered data is stored).

<h2>**UPDATE**</h2>
Running the mainFilter.py will get you every functionality from all the filters, and you will have filtered up-to date data in filtered_stock.csv
